Hi, I'm Guojian from China and currently live in Singapore.

I have been a Software Engineer for more than ten years and have worked in two listed companies([***Tencent***](https://www.tencent.com/){:target="_blank"} and [***Sea Limited***](https://www.sea.com/){:target="_blank"}).

During these years, I have practised plenty of techniques(*Network Programming*, *Relational Database*, *Distributed Computing*, *Concurrent Computing*) and methodologies(*TDD*, *DDD*, *CI/CD*, *Project Management*) in various programming languages(***C++***, ***Python***, ***Go***) and different projects(*E-commerce*, *Service Mesh*) in my career.

Besides engineering, my interests are ***philosophy***(Logic and Metaphysics) and ***mathematics***(Formal Systems).
