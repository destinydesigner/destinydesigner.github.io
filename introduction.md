<!-- particulars -->
Hi, I'm Guojian from China and currently live in Singapore.

<!-- Working experience -->
With over a decade of experience as a Software Engineer, I've had the opportunity to contribute to two publicly traded companies, ([***Tencent***](https://www.tencent.com/){:target="_blank"} and [***Sea Limited***](https://www.sea.com/){:target="_blank"}). Presently, I serve as an Engineering Director at [***OKX***](https://www.okx.com/){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- Technical skills -->
Throughout my career, I have honed a wide array of skills and methodologies, including Network Programming, Relational Database, Distributed Computing, and Concurrent Computing, as well as TDD, DDD, CI/CD, and Agile. I've applied these in multiple programming languages, such as ***C++***, ***Python***, ***Go***, and ***Java***, across various domains like *E-commerce*, *Crypto*, *Marketing*, *Service Mesh & Service Governance*, and *Cloud Computing*.

<!-- Interpersonal skills -->
I leverage a fact-based approach to interpersonal interactions, prioritizing professionalism and respect in all workplace relationships. I value autonomy and encourage my team to experiment and learn from failures, fostering an environment of trust and growth. However, I maintain high standards for reliability and accountability; if trust is compromised, I adopt a more hands-on approach to ensure objectives are met and to restore team dynamics.


<!-- interests and hobbies -->
Beyond the realm of engineering, my passions extend to ***philosophy***, particularly in the areas of Logic and Metaphysics, as well as ***mathematics***, with a focus on Formal Systems.
